# [yeet-cli](https://github.com/YeetCode-devs/yeet-cli)
Welcome to yeet-cli! This is a command-line tool that leverages the upcoming yeet-api to provide a user-friendly
interface for interacting with it. This tool is written in Python and is aimed to be as friendly as possible towards
the community, so you can build your own tools, too.

Note that currently yeet-cli is in major development, and is currently unstable to be used.
